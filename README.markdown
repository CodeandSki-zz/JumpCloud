# JumpCloud UI Engineer Assignment

## Instructions

Using the code already in this repository as a starting point, please create
the front end for a simple "ToDo" application. The applicaction should allow
the user to:

- Create a new todo item
- Display a list of todo items
- Update an existing todo item
  - Toggle the done status
  - Change the description
- Delete a todo item

A simple API has been created at `http://localhost:8004/api/todos` that
will function as the back end. The solution should demonstrate your ability to:

- Organize front end code
- Interact with an existing API
- Use a front end JavaScript framework (e.g. _Angular_, _Backbone_, _React_, _Vue_ )
- Style your work using either custom CSS or a CSS framework
- Create scalable and secure code

Tests are _NOT_ required!
