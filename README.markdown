# JumpCloud UI Engineer Assignment

## Instructions
Using the code already in this repository, please create the front end for a simple "ToDo" application. The app should support the ability to view and edit/complete existing todos, add new todos, and delete todos. A simple API has been created at `http://localhost:3004/api/todos` that will function as the back end. The solution should demonstrate your ability to:
- Organize front end code
- Inteact with an existing API
- Take advantage of the MVC pattern (preferably in _Backbone_)
- Style your work (preferably with a CSS preprocessor)
- Create scalable and secure code
